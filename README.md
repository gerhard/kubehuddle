CI/CD is what gets your code from your laptop to your Kubernetes.

If that is not the case, this talk is not for you. What if I told you that you've been holding CI/CD wrong all this time?
If you cannot run it locally, need to wait more than 5 minutes to see if a change works, and get goose bumps when someone on your team mentions migrating CI/CD, you're holding it wrong.

After decades thinking about this problem, this is what holding it right means to me.
Kubernetes is a small piece of the puzzle, and contrary to what many think, it should not be used to solve all problems.
I learned this from someone else, and also... Join me if you are curious to see where this goes.
